# Who we are

## What is World IA Day?

World IA Day is the one day a year the community gets together for a global conference, curated and organized by volunteers around the world, to host and encourage conversations about information architecture.

## What is Information Architecture?

Definitions for "information architecture" are a constant conversation topic in this community. For a discipline focused on making things easy to understand, Information Architecture certainly does not make that easy.

The World Information Architecture Association invites open conversations about "What is Information Architecture" to sustain an ecosystem of learning and collaboration.

## Be a regional director or local affiliate
