# Who we are

## What is World IA Day?

World IA Day is the one day a year the community gets together for a global conference, curated and organized by volunteers around the world, to host and encourage conversations about information architecture.

World Information Architecture Association (legal name World IA Day, Inc.; WIAA) is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization dedicated to growing awareness of the discipline of information architecture while promoting social responsibility among practitioners.

## Our Mission

World IA Association is committed to empowering local communities and leaders who share the common goal of teaching, learning, and shaping the future of Information Architecture. Our mission is to spread information architecture practice:

* Build and connect a global community of IA advocates and practitioners
* Promote the role of IA in different fields
* Provide resources for learning and professional development
* Engage IA academics and professionals in research and development

## What is Information Architecture?

Definitions for "information architecture" are a constant conversation topic in this community. For a discipline focused on making things easy to understand, Information Architecture certainly does not make that easy.

The World Information Architecture Association invites open conversations about "What is Information Architecture" to sustain an ecosystem of learning and collaboration.
