# Finance & Development

The Finance Committee will review and make recommendations on how World IA Day handles money as an organization. The goal is to ensure fiscal transparency, legal compliance, financial solvency, and operational reliability. It is the Finance Committee's mission to make financial flows across the organization as transparent as possible and direct significant resources to all new business (sponsorships, partnerships, etc) and any old business that has financial implications that have not been provided for in the organization budget.&#x20;

In addition, it is the responsibility of the committee to:&#x20;

* handle contracts, sponsorship, partnership, and general fundraising
* monitor overall financial performance&#x20;
* research and develop sponsorships and partnerships
