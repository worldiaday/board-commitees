# World IA Day Committees

Besides getting involved at the local level and organizing World IA Day events, you can also get involved by showing initiative and leadership at one of the various World IA Day committees

## **What are committees?**

Committees:

* **may be permanent** -- e.g. Events. Committees tend to be created by those with high context but low capacity for action (such as officers or directors) as committee chairs and recruit contributors who are able to volunteer/act as stewards.&#x20;
* **may be temporary** -- "task force" committees for certain purpose- may be subcommittees. For instance, a task force may be created to handle a certain/specific CoC incident

Chair commitments last about a year with the ability to advance to the Board.
